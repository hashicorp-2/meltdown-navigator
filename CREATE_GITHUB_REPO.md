# 🚀 Create GitHub Repository - Step by Step

## 📋 Quick Steps

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `meltdown-navigator`
3. **Description:** (optional) "Crisis communication translator for neurodivergent individuals"
4. **Visibility:**
   - ✅ **Public** (recommended - free Vercel deployment)
   - OR Private (if you have Vercel Pro)
5. **IMPORTANT - DO NOT:**
   - ❌ Initialize with README
   - ❌ Add .gitignore
   - ❌ Choose a license
6. **Click:** "Create repository"

### Step 2: After Creating

GitHub will show you instructions, but we already have the commands ready!

**Just run these commands:**

```bash
cd /Users/ogowemr/meltdown-navigator
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ✅ That's It!

Once you create the repo and push, it will appear at:
**https://github.com/hashicorp-2/meltdown-navigator**

Then you can:
- Import it to Vercel
- Share it with others
- See it in your GitHub profile

**Go create the repo now, then come back and we'll push!** 🚀
